- The tool prompts you to select a license, which it adds as a badge
- The tool asks for installation, contribution, and testing info, as well as FAQs and puts them all into sections
- The tool creates a clickable table of contents
- The tool creates a markdown file based on the name of your project, or updates an existing one if it already exists in the repository
